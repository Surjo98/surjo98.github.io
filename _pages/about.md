Hello! I'm Surjo Dutta, a dedicated software engineer and data scientist with an endless passion for unraveling the intricacies of data and technology. My journey through the realms of Engineering Physics and Data Science has equipped me with a unique blend of skills, enabling me to view problems through a multifaceted lens.

Driven by deep-rooted curiosity, I ventured into the world of algorithms and machine learning, not just as academic subjects, but as tools to visualize and understand the world around us. My experience at Intel Corporation and John Deere, coupled with my academic endeavors at the University of Sydney and the University of Illinois, has honed my ability to transform theoretical concepts into practical solutions.

But my aspirations stretch beyond the technical realm. I believe in the power of data to revolutionize how we approach everyday challenges. Whether it's enhancing operational safety with real-time detection systems or pushing the boundaries of medical diagnostics through AI, my goal is to leverage my training to create impactful solutions.

Here, you'll find a portfolio of my projects - each a testament to my commitment to innovation and excellence. From devising algorithms for automated lawnmowers to exploring the potential of Transformers in MRI segmentation, every project echoes my philosophy: to blend diverse knowledge for groundbreaking advancements.

Join me on this journey as I continue to explore the convergence of data science, machine learning, and physics, striving always to contribute meaningfully to our collective future.
